            Internships give students the opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths; and give employers the opportunity to guide and evaluate talent. (National Association of Colleges and Employers)

            Our sport clubs are the perfect place to release your inner athlete and often make for a great excuse to hang out at the beach. Or, you can experience hands-on media training with CisternYard Media, an organization that controls our campus television studio, radio station, the newsroom and our award-winning literary magazine, <em>Miscellany</em>.</p>
